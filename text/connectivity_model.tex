    We structure our physical connectivity graph as\ldots

    The origins of our data are entirely borrowed techniques.\footnote{As good
    Berkeley students, we make an homage to one of our dear professors with
    this sentence.} We derive our physical connectivity points from the IXP
    Mapping Project~\cite{ixps-mapped}, iPlane~\cite{iplane}, and applying
    iPlane's techniques to traceroute data from Aqualab~\cite{sidewalk} and
    CAIDA~\cite{caidadata}.

        What our data is.
        How we piece it together.
        \subsubsection*{Evaluation of Model}
            \begin{itemize}
        \item survey random network providers and ask them if what we
        found was correct
        \item compare physical links discovered to logical connectivity
        graph (CAIDA provides this) - what fraction of logical links
        did we observe? For Tier-1's? For Tier-2's? For stub networks?
            \end{itemize}
