Our work builds on and takes inspiration from research in Internet resilience analysis, experience from Internet outages, PoP-level Internet topology measurement studies, and network infrastructure security policy.

{\bf Resilience Analysis.}
    Comprehensive analysis of Internet resilience remains beyond reach due to limited access to global routing and topology data. 
    However, limited studies provide insight into the impact of logical link failures and opportunities to make the AS graph more robust to these failures.
    
    Wu et. al~\cite{michigan} provide the most in-depth analysis of Internet resilience under {\it logical} link failure.
    Using an AS-level graph, they removed one or more peering relationships and evaluated the availability of policy-compliant paths between impacted networks before and after the logical link failure.

    Omer et. al~\cite{measuringresilience} consider undersea cables as capacity bottlenecks for Internet connectivity between continents. 
    Like us, they look for constraints in the physical, rather than logical connectivity graph. 
    However, their model focuses on inter-continental connectivity rather and does not focus on IXPs as correlated failure points. 

    \justine{hey ksteph, can you add a line or two for each of these that provide a direct comparison to what we do and why it's different?}
    Albert et al.~\cite{resilience-complex-networks} studied two different
    complex networks: Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) and scale-free. An ER model
    produces a network with an exponential tail and a scale-free has a power-law
    tail for node degree. Against random node removal the scale-free model had a
    high degree of tolerance, while the ER model was not. However for a
    deliberate attack of removing the most connected nodes the scale-free model
    quickly deteriorates and the ER model is effected the same as if they were
    randomly removed.
    %After reading this, let's make sure to also try to come to some conclusions
    %about the properties of the graph we create.
    %Note: the Internet does not exhibit the power law!

    Dolev et al.~\cite{resilience-under-BGP} looked at an AS-level graph based
    on BGP policy directionality and connectivity. They found that the Internet
    is much more susceptible to deliberate attacks of removing the AS's with
    highest degree than previous studies that did not take into consideration
    BGP polices.
    %Their metrics might be useful for us: average shortest path length, size of
    %largest component, number of connected node pairs in the network, ratio
    %between pairs connected and all pairs
    
    Hu et. al~\cite{ixp-routingdiversity} also investigate logical failures on an AS-level graph, focusing opportunities to limit the impact of logical failures.
    %They looked at relaxing peering constraints (relax valley-freeness)
    Like us, they augmented thair AS graph with IXP connectivity data.
    Unlike our work, they did not use this data to consider the possibility of correlated failures.
    Rather, they investigated using IXPs to provide backup peers to improve connectivity in case of emergency. 

{\bf Outage Events.}
    Real outage events highlight the threat of correlated failure in geographic locations which suffer disaster or attack.
    For example, the 2006 Boxing Day Earthquake in Taiwan resulted in major Internet outages when six of seven undersea cables connecting North and Southeast Asia with eachother and North America disconnected~\cite{asia-comm-quake}. 
    While the earthquake did not cause complete disconnectivity, the affected networks suffered heavy congestion until the cables were repaired.
    This experience serves already as a case study for emergency restoration in case of disaster~\cite{taiwan}. 
        
    \justine{agreed wrt the 2003 study, doesn't look as relevant as the Taiwan quake}
    %\item Restoration study~\cite{taiwan}

    %\item 2003 Blackout in Northeastern US and Canada~\cite{blackout2003}. Cowie
    %et al. Looked at the prefixes that were effected by the blackout. They found
    %that even though the Internet backbone providers were unaffected by the
    %blackout many businesses were offline for hours to days, which affected many.
    %Note sure if this report will be very useful, only looked at connectivity
    %in the geographical area of the blackout, not how the blackout affected the
    %general Internet traffic patterns and such.

    %After the Taiwan earthquake in 2006 the Internet was resilient, but
    %congested~\cite{asia-comm-quake}. The Internet was able to recover and
    %switch to back-ups relatively quickly. However the loss of service can still
    %be catastrophic for both ISP's and businesses. Businesses lose information
    %needed to run their business, while ISP's lose traffic due to congestion or
    %must switch to backup links that are usually more expensive without
    %compensation.

{\bf PoP-level Internet Topologies.}
    Our model for network connectivity focuses on {\it failure points}, physical locations where multiple networks connect, leading to multiple correlated failures in case of disaster.
    We borrow techniques and data for discovering these physical locations from iPlane~\cite{iplane} and the IXP Mapping Project~\cite{ixps-mapped}.
    iPlane clusters IP addresses into PoPs using a combination of DNS-based geolocation and TTL-based distance measurements.
    The IXP Mapping project uses public IXP membership datasets, DNS names, looking glass servers, BGP tables, active traceroute and ping measurements, and other sources to provide the most accurate IXP membership datasets available to date.
